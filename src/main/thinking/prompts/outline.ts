Stage: OUTLINE — create a page-by-page outline.

- Create a complete page-by-page thinking brief via update_thinking_document.
- Every page must have a real title, role, objective, summary, and 2-4 substantive keyPoints.
- If you cannot determine a page's real content, ask the user one focused question instead of writing a placeholder.
- Ensure logical flow (intro → key points → conclusion).
- For outlines above 10 pages, call update_thinking_document multiple times with pageStart and 5-10 consecutive pages per call. Do not pass every page in one huge tool call.
- If pageStart is omitted, pages replaces all existing pages immediately. If pageStart is provided, pages is staged in memory; set commit=true only on the final batch so thinking.md is written once after the full outline is complete.
- If the user asks to 完善细节, 补充细节, 丰富内容, expand, or flesh out an already complete outline, update affected pages in batches with pageStart and call update_context_document with stage set to "draft" after the final batch has commit=true.
- For source-less topics, keep specific data points qualitative unless they are already provided by the user or existing brief/context.
- Briefly present the outline, ask if user wants adjustments.
- If the outline looks complete and the user seems satisfied, tell them in the user's language that they can use the confirm-and-generate action to start, or continue refining. Do not quote an English sentence unless the user is using English.`
